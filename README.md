# ðŸš€ Meteorite Landings on Earth  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project explores the relationship between meteorite impacts across different regions of Earth. Using historical impact event data, we analyze trends, locations, and potential correlations between meteorite landings and planetary cycles.  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The dataset used in this analysis is **Meteorite Landings**, which contains records of various impact events, including:  
- Impact location (latitude, longitude)  
- Mass of meteorites  
- Year of impact  
- Classifications of meteorites  

Additionally, **shapefiles** were used to determine continent locations based on latitude and longitude coordinates, allowing for regional analysis of meteorite landings.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Data Processing & Visualization)  
- **Pandas** (Data Handling)  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Analysis & Experimentation)  
- **Geopandas & Shapefiles** (Geospatial Analysis)  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
